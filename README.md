# Project Sylvanas - Classic Class OpenSource Plugin System

Welcome to the **Project Sylvanas Classic Era/HardCore Class Plugin System**!  
This project provides a modular plugin architecture for automating WoW Classic gameplay. Each class has its own folder and dedicated plugin.
This project is created to encourage open source class rotations from the community!
